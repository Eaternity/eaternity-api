# Eaternity API
### Summary
The Eaternity Database API is a Web Service that calculates the Climate Score (CO₂eq), the Vita Score and other environmental footprints of recipes (by posting them to our [recipe ressource](#recipe-resources-batch-operations-on-recipe-resources-post)), restaurants (by posting supplies to our [supply ressource](#supply-resources-supply-collection-post)) and ingredients dynamically. It includes daily changing information on origin,
seasonality and other factors in the calculation ([more Informations on the indicators](http://www.eaternity.org/foodprint/)). Data provided to Eaternity via this API allows for in-depth analyses and reports ([more Informations on the reports](http://www.eaternity.org/app/report)).

# Group Kitchen Resources
The first step to using the Eaternity API is to create a kitchen. A kitchen is a place where food is prepared and sold. It can be a restaurant, a factory, a canteen or anything similar. The kitchen resource contains all information about the kitchen, including the name, location. Kitchens are the basic grouping for recipes and supplies. Reports and statistics are provided on this level.

## Kitchen Properties
| Property | Type  | Description      | Required |
|:----------|:--------|:------------------|:----------|
|name |string |official name of the kitchen or factory |yes|
|location |string |place where the kitchen is located. Address or country (arbitrary format) |yes|
|email|string |email address of the kitchen where the reports are sent to |no|
|language|string | language of the reports for the kitchen |no|
|id|string|the id of the kitchen. Either generated by Eaternity or supplied by the client.|no|

## Kitchen Collection [/kitchens/]
### Create new kitchen [POST]
This endpoint creates a new kitchen. If the kitchen id is not provided, a new id is generated. The id must be unique for each kitchen. The id is used to identify the kitchen in all other requests. The id must be alphanumeric and can contain dashes and underscores. The id must not contain spaces or special characters.

# Group Recipe Resources

A recipe is a collection of ingredients, instructions and other information that describes how a food item sold in a restaurant is composed. It is the basis for the calculation of the CO₂-value and other indicators. The recipe resource contains all information about the recipe, including the ingredients, instructions, and other metadata.

### Uniqueness of Recipes
Note that for every time, a recipe is offered in a kitchen, a new id has to be used.

_Example 1:_

Your business runs Kitchen A and Kitchen B. On the 1st of April, both kitchens offer pumpkin risotto, using the same ingredients. You will have to create *two* different recipes with *two* different ids.

_Example 2_:

Your business runs Kitchen A and Kitchen B. On the 1st of April, both kitchens offer pumpkin risotto. On the 2nd of April, Kitchen A offers pumpkin risotto again. You will have to create *three* different recipes with *three* different ids.

### Sub-Recipes
In the examples above, all individual recipes may contain the identical sub-recipe pumpkin risotto as an ingredient, having the same id each time.
The sub-recipe pumpkin risotto will be stored only once in the database.
The drawback of reusing the id is that you will not be able to change the composition idividually without impacting all usages of the sub-recipe. So consider using individual ids for sub-recipes as well.

Make sure to that you are using the flag `transient=true` for the sub-recipes in any case. The sub-recipe on its own will then not be included in the monthly summary.


#### URL Parameters


| Parameters | Type  | Description      |
|:----------|:--------|:------------------|
|full-resource|boolean|Specifies whether our JSON answer will contain all fields (except the additional indicators) or a short answer. Default: false. Works for recipes and supplies. This helps to save bandwidth for slow connections.|
|indicators|boolean|Specifies whether the JSON answer will contain the additional indicator fields. Default: false. Works for recipes, ingredients, and supplies.|


## Batch Operations on Recipe Resources [/recipes/batch?full-resource=true&indicators=true]

Batch operations allow you to create, update or delete multiple recipes at once. They are the most efficient way to work with the Eaternity API. The batch operations can check consistency in between recipes that depend on each other. For example, if you have a recipe with a sub-recipe, the batch operation will check if the sub-recipe is also present in the batch and will return an error if it is not. Presence of sub-recipes is not validated with single requests.
 Batch operations are limited by the computational resources required for the calculations. We recommend a maximum of 100 recipes per request but the limit is not fixed. The server will return an error if the request is too large. The batch operations are not atomic, meaning that if one recipe fails, the others may still be processed. The response will contain the status of each recipe in the batch.

The `transient` parameter can be set selectively per recipe inside the batch. Transient recipes only contribute to the monthly summary and the kitchen's statistics if they are used as sub-recipes in other recipes that are not transient. Therefore `transient` should be set to `true` for recipes that are transmitted for use as sub-recipes or sent for testing purposes.

The message in each batch item provides more details about the failure of individual recipes.

### Create or update a batch of recipes [POST]
Create or update a batch of recipes at once. If a recipe id is provided, the recipe is either created with this id or the existing recipe is overwritten. The status code tells the difference.

The `kitchen-id` is used to attribute the impact to the respective kitchen's statistics.

The additional integer `request-id` field enables you to track back the recipes you sent in case you don't want to use your own ids. Either a request id or a recipe id is required.
The request-id differs from the recipe id and has just the lifetime of a single request.

---
In the following request, one menu item "Fitness Risotto" contains a single recipe "Mushroom gravy on pumpkin risotto".

This recipe is again composed of two recipes, "pumpkin risotto" and "Mushroom gravy". The recipes are all included in the batch.

The menu item is sold in the kitchen kitchen-restaurant-a on 2016 11 28. Note that each (sub-) recipe has to have a unique identifier ("id"). In our example the unique identifier for the menu "Fitness Risotto" is "menu-id1-fitness-2016-11-28" and for the "Mushroom gravy on pumpkin risotto" it is "internal-recipe-id3". The menu item is marked as not transient, meaning that it will be included in the monthly summary. The two recipes are transient, meaning that they will not again contribute to the monthly summary (their impact is already included in the menu item).

## Individual Recipes [/recipes]

If it suits your case better, instead of creating a batch of recipes, you can use the following resources to create, read, update and delete single recipes.


#### URL Parameters


| Parameters | Type  | Description      |
|:----------|:--------|:------------------|
|transient|boolean|Resources with the transient=true flag will not be saved. This is important as we do not want to include all of your recipes in our monthly summary. For example if you submit a sub-recipe, to check its co2-value, it should not be included in the statistics.|
### Create a recipe [POST]
Create a recipe resource and receive the CO₂-Value and Eaternity Award. Example of a full request with all fields used:

# Group Ingredient Properties

Each request for Recipes or Supplies contains a list of Ingredients. Each Ingredient requires at least an `id`, `name` and an `amount` but may contain additional specifications.
Ingredients with the same id are shared between all of your Recipes as well as Supplies.
There is no hard limit on the number of ingredients, but requests may time out and fail in the range of more than 25 ingredients, especially in combination with batch requests.

### Ingredient Properties In Requests
| Property | Type  | Description    | Required |
|:----------|:--------|:------------------|:----------|
|id|string| your unique id of the ingredient|yes|
|type|string|either *conceptual-ingredients* or *recipes*. *conceptual-ingredients* specifies a normal ingredient, *recipes* references to an already existing recipe. Default: *conceptual-ingredients*|no|
|names|list of language object|full name of ingredient in different languages (array of language objects). Name in at least one language required.|yes|
|amount|float|amount of the ingredient in the specified unit|yes|
|unit|string|unit of the given amount of the ingredient: *gram* or *liter*, default: *gram*|no|
|origin|string|origin of the ingredient: postal address or country |best practice|

E.g.: "Hähnchenbrustfilet (53 %), Panade (28%) (Weizenmehl, Wasser, modifizierte Weizen-stärke, Weizenstärke, Speisesalz, Gewürze, Hefe), Wasser, Putenformfleisch-schinken aus Putenfleischteilen zusammengefügt (7 %) (Putenkeulenfleisch, Nitritpökelsalz (Kochsalz, Konservierungsstoff: E 250), Maltodextrin, Dextrose, Gewürzextrakte, Stabilisator: E450), Käse (7 %), Kartoffelstärke, Stabilisator: modifizierte Stärke, Salz), Speisesalz, Stärke, Maltodextrin, Milcheiweiß, Pflanzeneiweiß, Dextrose, Zucker, Gewürzextrakte, Geschmacksverstärker: E 620"|no|
|nutrient-values|list of nutrient values |Structured list of the nutrients values per defined nutrient as defined below.|no|
|gtin|string|global trade item number: [www.gtin.info](http://www.gtin.info/)|no|

To reduce ambiguity and minimize manual follow-ups, we strongly recommend specifying certain ingredient attributes, even if technically optional. These include indicators such as air-freighted, fresh, deep-frozen, dried, preserved, baked, canned, boiled, organic, Fairtrade certified, and aquaculture-sourced (for fish). Providing this data up front helps prevent incorrect assumptions and eliminates the need for iterative clarification with you as the client.

### Ingredient Properties In Responses only

# Group Impact Indicators

The Eaternity API provides access to a set of indicators for evaluating the environmental impact and nutritional quality of recipes, ingredients, and supplies. These indicators support informed decision-making and promote sustainability within the food industry.

## CO₂-Value

The CO₂-Value represents the amount of CO₂e emissions associated with a recipe, supply, or ingredient, expressed in grams. It is calculated based on the specified ingredient properties, with predictive models filling in any missing data. The CO₂-Value serves as a core indicator of the environmental footprint. For details on the calculation methodology, refer to the [Eaternity CO₂-Value documentation](https://eaternity.notion.site). The return values for CO₂ are documented [here](https://eaternity.github.io/eaternity-api/#header-ingredient-properties-in-responses-only).

## Additional Indicator Results

When the URL parameter `indicators=true` is included in the request, the response JSON will include a collection of additional indicators for Recipes, Ingredients, and Supplies. These indicators are returned in the following format:

## Supply Collection [/kitchens/{kitchen_id}/supplies/]

+ Parameters
    + kitchen_id (string, required) - the id of the kitchen.

### Create a batch of supplies [POST]
Create or update a batch of supplies at once. If a supply id is provided, the supply is either created with this id or the existing supply is overwritten. The status code tells the difference. The `full-resource` and `indicators` parameters are supported.

The additional `request-id` field enables you to track back the supply you sent in case you don't want to use your own id. Either a request id or a recipe id is required.
The request-id differs from the supply id and has just the lifetime of a single request (not stored on Eaternity's end).

# Group Product Resources for Retail
The Product resourcres are directed towards users that have limited information about a single retail food product's composition and want to calculate indicators based on the mandatory ingredient and nutrients declaration on its packaging. We only recommend using the Product Resources in tight coordination with the team at Eaternity as the calculations require additional supervision from our team. We process it and build a recipe-like structure so we can serve the usual indicators.

# Group Forecast Resources

A forecast of sold menu portions can be generated based on all planned recipes of a kitchen.
The forecast calculation takes into account the previously supplied sales of the corresponding kitchen.
For the forecast to work, we need at least 10 consecutive days with menus (including full recipes and sales data). Better is more. You will receive a warning if we have too little data for a prediction.

An example API call to create a prognosis:

`curl -i -X POST "https://co2.eaternity.ch/api/prognosis/YOURKITCHENID/forecast" --header "authorization: Basic YOURKEY" --header "accept: */*" --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"date-start\":\"2019-03-04\",\"date-end\":\"2019-03-08\",\"async\":true}"`

## Create a new forecast [/prognosis/{kitchen_id}/forecast]

+ Parameters
    + kitchen_id (string, required) - the id of the kitchen.

### Create a forecast [POST]

This post request will create a new forecast calculation for the kitchen.
The request is kept open until the calculation is finished. 
Alternatively, if `async: true` is provided, the request returns directly a new forecast resource locator without waiting for the calculation to be finished.

+ Parameters
    + kitchen_id (string) - the id of the kitchen, for which the prognosis is calculated

+ Request (application/json)

    + Attributes (object)
        + `date-start` (string) - Specify the start date of the prognosis. Format: "YYYY-MM-DD".
        + `date-end` (string) - Specify the end date of the prognosis. Format: "YYYY-MM-DD".
        + `async` (boolean) - If true, the request returns directly a prediction_id without waiting for the calculation to finish. Default: false.

# Group Advanced Information

### Localization
The API is designed such that one request may contain information about an object (e.g. a recipe or a supply) in multiple languages.
Every JSON field which is subject to localization has a language array as value. One language object looks like this:

`{
    "language": "de",
    "value": "Kürbisrisotto"
}`

Example of recipe title language array:

`"titles": [
{
    "language": "de",
    "value": "Kürbisrisotto"
},
{
    "language": "en",
    "value": "Pumpkin Risotto"
}]`

The language field must contain one of the [ISO 639-1](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) alpha-2 codes as a descriptor for the language you use.


### Id Generation
The ids of recipes, kitchens and supplies can be generated in two different ways. The first possibility is to create a new resource through a `POST` to the API, then the id is generated by Eaternity.
The second possibility is to create a new resource through a `PUT`, providing your own id in the URL itself (e.g. /recipes/298734), then your id is used on our servers. This is the recommended approach, as it helps us coordinating your requests.
The id can be any alphanumeric value following this [regular expression](https://regexr.com/3mho5): [-a-zA-Z0-9+&@#/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[-a-zA-Z0-9+&@#/%=~_|] (the allowed characters for a HTTP URL).

### Notes On The Format
The API accepts JSON in requests. It returns JSON in all of its responses, including errors. Only the UTF-8 character encoding is supported for both requests and responses.

### SSL
All requests need to be encrypted through SSL. Please make sure to whitelist the latest SSL certificate from Eaternity.

You can find the latest certificates by accessing the specific domain.

We recommend to whitelist the cloudflare root certificate "cloudflare_origin_rsa.pem", as follows all our domains and any renewal will be secured (test.eaternity.ch and co2.eaternity.ch). Be advised that if you prefer whitelisting our individual domain names (e.g.: "cloudflare-eaternity.ch-2017.crt"), you will have to renew it each year in time, to not interrupt your service.

#### Use Server Name Indication (SNI)
Since Eaternity uses distributed Google servers, the IP-address of the service changes and are shared between different applications.

To make SSL work for the Eaternity Database API, the desired hostname (co2.eaternity.ch) needs to be specified with every request according to the SNI-Speficiation. An example request to our service including SNI, using the `-servername` argument is as follows:

`openssl s_client -connect co2.eaternity.ch:443 -servername eaternity.ch`

### Server Responses
Next to common HTTP status codes, the Eaternity API uses a set of custom status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. The following table lists the used status codes and their meanings:


* 200   `OK` - If a resource was requested, it will be available at the top level of the response body.
* 201   `Created` -  The request was successful and a resource was created. The Location Header field indicates the URI the resource can be found.
* 204   `No Content` - The request was successful and the body intentionally contains no data.

* 400   `Bad request` - This occurs when the request was not sent according to the documentation. Can be either the JSON format or the content. Check the documentation and the syntax of your request and try again.
* 401   `Unauthorized` - A valid API key was not provided with the request, so the API could not associate a client with the request.
* 403   `Forbidden` - The Kitchen is not authorized to calculate environmental values of recipes. Only users that pay for the "Eaternity License" are allowed to do so. Please contact Eaternity to get an up-to-date pricing.
* 404   `Not Found` - Either the request method and path supplied do not specify a known action in the API, or the object specified by the request does not exist.
* 405   `Method Not Allowed` - When the resource exists but the HTTP method verb is not allowed on this resource.
* 422   `Unprocessable Content` - When the request is not valid against the schema we ask. For example you send an integer where a string was expected.

* 500   `Internal Server Error` - Unexpected error. If you receive this error, please try again later. If the error persists, please contact Eaternity support.
* 502   `Bad Gateway` - The request could not be completed because the Eaternity API is currently not responding to the Content Delivery Network. Please try again later.

* 602   `Automatic matching missing` - For at least one ingredient name no matching rules to the Eaternity Database were found. Retry once a day or try with a different ingredient name.
* 610   `Missing required property` - A required resource property was not given in the request. Please provide the required field.
* 611   `Wrong property value` - A resource property was not provided according to the documentation. Either the given format is wrong or the value does not match to the given options. Usually not dependent on the implementation but on the user input.
* 612   `Referenced sub-recipe is not in the database.` - A referenced recipe was not provided in this or a previous request. Please provide the required recipe in advance.
* 670   `At least one (sub-) recipe has no ingredients.` - “Something of nothing” does not work. You referenced a positive quantity of a sub-recipe that did have any quantitity itself.
* 673   `Amount Estimation Failed` - For at least one ingredient, amount estimation failed. This is caused by inconclusive nutrient values or missing ingredient information. Please check the ingredient or wait for manual matching.
* 674   `Ingredient Splitter Failed` - The ingredient splitter could not split the ingredient declaration into ingredients. This is caused by inconclusive ingredient information. Please check the ingredient or wait for manual matching.
* 678   `CO₂ calculation failed` - The CO₂ calculation failed. An unknown issue occurred. The response body will otherwise be complete. Please try again later or contact Eaternity support.
* 679   `Vita Score calculation not possible` - The Vita Score calculation failed. An unknown issue occurred. The response body will otherwise be complete. Please try again later or contact Eaternity support.
* 681   `Storage time to low`- For at least one ingredient, even the fastest mode of transport was too slow given the storage time. Nevertheless, the fastest mode was added as a fallback.
